## How to Use

To use the Background Remover project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/background-remover.git
   ```

2. **Obtain Remove.bg API Key:** To access the Remove.bg API, you need an API key. Visit the [Remove.bg Documentation](https://remove.bg/api) and sign up for an API key if you haven't already.

3. **Set API Key:** Once you have the API key, open the `script.js` file in the project directory using a text editor. Look for the following line of code:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

4. **Start a Live Server:** Now, you need to run the project using a live server to interact with the application. If you have Node.js installed, you can use the popular `live-server` package. If you don't have it, you can install it globally using:

   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```

5. **Launch the Application:** After installing `live-server`, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   live-server
   ```

   The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html`. Open this link in your web browser.

6. **Uploading and Removing Backgrounds:** Once the application is open in your web browser, you can upload an image from your local machine using the "Choose File" button. After selecting the image, click on the "Remove Background" button. The application will make a request to the Remove.bg API using your API key to remove the background from the image.

7. **Download the Result:** Once the background removal process is complete, you will see the processed image with the background removed. You can now download this image to your computer by clicking on the "Download" button.

   **Note:** The Remove.bg API has rate limits and usage restrictions, so make sure to check their documentation for more details.
